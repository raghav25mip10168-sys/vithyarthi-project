Project Overview
This is a simple Number Guessing Game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the game informs the player whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. This project is useful for beginners to learn about loops, conditions, and using the random module.

How to Play
Start the game; the computer will choose a hidden number.

Enter your guess as a number between 1 and 100.

The game will give feedback: guess is too high, too low, or correct.

Keep guessing until you find the correct number.

The game will also display the number of attempts taken.

Installation and Running
